== Description ==

VK Dynamic If Block is a custom WordPress block, primarily designed for FSE, that allows users to display Innder Block based on specified conditions. With this block, you can show or hide Innder Block depending on various conditions, such as whether the current page is the front page, a single post, a specific Post Type, or other conditions.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the block editor to add a "Dynamic If" block to your post or page.
