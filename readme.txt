VK Dynamic If Block displays its Inner Blocks based on specified conditions, such as whether the current page is the front page or a single post, the post type, or the value of a Custom Field.

== Description ==

VK Dynamic If Block is a custom WordPress block, primarily designed for FSE, that allows users to display Inner Block based on specified conditions. With this block, you can show or hide Inner Block depending on various conditions, such as whether the current page is the front page or a single post, the post type, or the value of a Custom Field.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/vk-dynamic-if-block' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the block editor to add a "Dynamic If" block to your post or page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use multiple conditions? =

You cannot specify too many conditions.
However, by nesting Dynamic If Blocks, various conditional branching can be handled.
